The idea is straightforward; there is a secret rule that readers have to guess. They present the sequence 2, 4, 8 that obeys one rule and they let them propose new sequences to guess the rule. It turns out that this simple game is amazingly useful to teach testing. Here I explain my last experience teaching introduction to test.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Fist is first`}</h2>\n    <p>{`I always start the introduction to testing with one sentence about testing.

Yes, I can change the rule and all cases still passing.

Testing does not show the absence of bugs.
